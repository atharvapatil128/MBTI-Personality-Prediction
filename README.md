Hi, you've arrived at the repo of MBTI Personality Prediction. 

In this project the **Myers-Briggs Personality** Type Dataset was used as a training set and Forum messages from **Meta Kaggle Dataset** were used as the testing set for the model. Data prepartion and cleaning were done before training the model. **Logistic Regression Model** was used to get the appropriate results. The results obtained, when the model was tested on the Kaggle Users Data, was plotted on a bar graph and which personality type most Kaggle users belong to was also observed.
